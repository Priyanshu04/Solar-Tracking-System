# Solar-Tracking-System

Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources available, offering a
sustainable solution to the global energy crisis. However, the efficiency of solar panels is
highly dependent on their orientation relative to the sun. A solar tracking system can
significantly enhance the performance of solar panels by continuously aligning them with the
sun's position throughout the day. This project explores the design and implementation of an
Arduino-based solar tracking system that maximizes the energy harvested from solar panels.
The proposed system utilizes light-dependent resistors (LDRs) as sensors to detect the sun's
position. Four LDRs are strategically placed around the solar panel to capture the intensity of
sunlight from different directions. The Arduino microcontroller processes the signals from
these sensors and controls two servo motors, which adjust the panel's orientation in both the
horizontal and vertical axes.
This project provides a practical solution for enhancing solar energy systems, making them
more viable for widespread use in both residential and commercial applications. Future
enhancements could include integrating weather prediction algorithms and wireless
communication to further optimize performance and allow for remote monitoring and
control.


INTRODUCTION:
Solar energy is a vital component of the global renewable energy landscape, offering a clean,
sustainable, and inexhaustible source of power. As the demand for alternative energy solutions
continues to rise, optimizing the efficiency of solar panels becomes increasingly important.
Traditional stationary solar panels capture only a fraction of the available solar energy due to
their fixed orientation, which limits their exposure to direct sunlight throughout the day.
To address this limitation, a solar tracking system is employed to dynamically adjust the
position of solar panels, ensuring they remain perpendicular to the sun’s rays from sunrise to
sunset. This continuous alignment significantly enhances the panels' efficiency by maximizing
the amount of sunlight absorbed.
This project focuses on developing a dual-axis solar tracking system using an Arduino
microcontroller. The system uses light-dependent resistors (LDRs) to detect the sun's position
and servo motors to adjust the orientation of the solar panel .By incorporating cost-effective
and readily available components, the project aims to provide a practical and scalable solution
for improving solar energy harvesting.
The proposed system not only aims to increase the energy output of solar panels but also to
promote the adoption of renewable energy technologies by making them more accessible and
efficient. Through this project, we explore the potential of solar tracking systems to contribute
significantly to the global energy transition, supporting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and mitigate climate change.
In summary, this project aims to design, implement, and validate a solar tracking system that
enhances the performance of solar panels, providing a valuable tool for both residential and
commercial applications. By leveraging the capabilities of Arduino and integrating simple
sensors and motors, the project demonstrates a practical approach to optimizing solar energy
utilization.

The efficiency of solar panels is highly dependent on their orientation relative to the sun. A
fixed solar panel's efficiency is limited by its inability to follow the sun's trajectory, which
changes throughout the day and across different seasons. A solar tracking system addresses
this limitation by continuously adjusting the panel's position to maximize exposure to direct
sunlight. This project utilizes a dual-axis tracking system controlled by an Arduino
microcontroller to achieve optimal alignment.
1. Solar Tracking Principles
Solar tracking involves adjusting the position of solar panels to follow the sun’s movement
across the sky. There are two primary types of solar tracking systems:
Single-axis trackers: These adjust the panel's angle along one axis (usually east-west or northsouth).
Dual-axis trackers: These adjust the panel's angle along both the horizontal (azimuth) and
vertical (elevation) axes, providing more comprehensive tracking and maximizing solar
exposure throughout the day and year.
2. Components of the System
Arduino Microcontroller: Acts as the central control unit, processing input from sensors and
controlling the actuators.
Light-Dependent Resistors (LDRs): Serve as light sensors that detect the intensity of sunlight.
When strategically placed, they provide real-time data on the sun's position.
Servo Motors: Responsible for adjusting the position of the solar panel. One servo motor
controls the horizontal movement, and another controls the vertical movement.
Solar Panel: The energy-harvesting component whose efficiency is to be maximized through
optimal orientation.

3. Working Mechanism
The system operates based on the following principles:
Sunlight Detection: Four LDRs are placed around the solar panel to detect sunlight intensity
from different directions.
Signal Processing: The Arduino microcontroller reads the analog signals from the LDRs. By
comparing the intensities, the Arduino determines the direction of the most intense sunlight.
Motor Control: Based on the LDR readings, the Arduino sends signals to the servo motors to
adjust the panel's orientation. The motors rotate the panel horizontally and vertically to align
it with the sun.
4. Control Algorithm
The control algorithm implemented in the Arduino can be summarized as follows:
Read LDR Values: Continuously monitor the analog input from the four LDRs.
Calculate Differences: Determine the differences in light intensity between pairs of LDRs.
Determine Movement: Decide the direction and magnitude of movement required for both
axes to equalize the light intensity readings.
Adjust Panel Position: Send signals to the servo motors to adjust the panel’s orientation.
Loop: Repeat the process continuously to keep the panel aligned with the sun.
